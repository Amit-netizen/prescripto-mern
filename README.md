* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually installed with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (Community Server)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Amit-netizen/prescripto-mern.git](https://github.com/Amit-netizen/prescripto-mern.git)
    cd prescripto-mern
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure backend environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
    * Add the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:
        ```env
        MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_for_jwt
        PORT=your_backend_server_port (e.g., 5000)
        # Add any other necessary environment variables
        ```

4.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev  # or yarn dev (if you have a dev script in package.json)
    ```
    The backend server should now be running on the specified port.

5.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

6.  **Configure frontend environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory.
    * Add the following environment variable, replacing the placeholder with your backend server URL:
        ```env
        REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:your_backend_server_port
        # Add any other frontend specific environment variables
        ```

7.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start  # or yarn start
    ```
    The frontend application should now be accessible in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.
